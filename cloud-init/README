You need these 3 files:
template.yaml
  --this is the file that the script pulls in to create the cloud init yaml using dynamic variables from with the .sh 
  --unlike the stackscript, this yaml uses the linode metatdata api to discover its own instance id.
  --this was necessary because cloud-init yamls can only be attached at initial instance creation, and therefore you do not know your id yet

debug.sh
  --rename this
  --this is the main deployment script. Now it does not need Stackscript
  --This file pulls in template.yaml and debug.config
  --This script now takes the yaml, base64 encodes it prior to instance creation, then attaches and moves on like normal 

debug.config
  --rename this too
  --this is the old instance.config
  --StackScript var is not used any longer. All else remains
